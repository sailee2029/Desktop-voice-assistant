# Desktop-voice-assistant
Desktop voice assistant is developed using csv, sqlite DB and GUI.
Once a user logins to the software the data will be stored in sqlite DB. Commands are added such that the user can easily handle any desktop applications through voice commands. All the browsed history will be saved in a table of DB and CSV file.
There is a mic which when clicked accepts user commands.
The whole project is developed in python with help of packages like pyttsx3,gtts,pygame,sqlite3.
There also is a small game "MATCH TILES" using pygame pacakge.
The application looks professional and is easy to use.
